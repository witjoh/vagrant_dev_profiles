The development profiles module.

These profiles are used to configure one or more vagrant boxes seting up
a consistent and (hopefully) working environment repo.

One can also setup a puppetdb and configure puppet apply nodes to test 
e.g. exported resources.  This is taken from https://github.com/witjoh/vagrant_puppetdb_apply
